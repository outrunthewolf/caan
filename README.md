caan, is a concept rather than a working system

# About
caan can maintain many realtime connections to a single server, through a single client side node, utilising P2P web sockets. The aim was to
reduce the many RTC connections to a single server from many clients, to one single RTC connection to a server from a single client, which
in turn supports many other clients through it
